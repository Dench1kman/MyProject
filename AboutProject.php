                        <b>Hello, I'm Denis</b>, the creator of this beautiful site. I want to immediately emphasize
                        that this site was created because of the desire of the developer to learn something new.
                        Creating a
                        website made me think more broadly, analyze the situation more, I also gained practical
                        experience in creating a website, studied new technologies, and, not least, I consolidated
                        the theory of product testing. I am going to develop directly as a <b>QA engineer</b> and one of
                        the
                        goals of creating a site is to transfer all my knowledge and make it accessible to everyone. I'm
                        not a professional developer, so you might find bugs by accident. If suddenly you find one,
                        contact me, I will leave the <u>contact details</u> on this page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If we talk about the <b>functionality of the website</b>, then this is a website on which the
                        user
                        can write down his goals that he wants to fulfill. On the <a
                            href="index.php"><b>Homepage</b></a>, you
                        can see the earliest active goal and the most recently completed goal. Also on this page, the
                        user can view the
                        latest news from the world of technology. Goals that the user has not yet completed or canceled
                        are displayed in the <a href="CurrentGoals.php"><b>Current Goals</b></a> section, and goals that
                        the user has completed are
                        displayed in the <a href="CompletedGoals.php"><b>Completed Goals</b></a> section. In the <a
                            href="Education.php"><b>Educational Material</b></a> section, the user can
                        see information that, according to the developer of this site, a QA engineer needs to know. And
                        finally, the section <a href="AboutProject.php"><b>About Project & Contact</b></a> - the section
                        on the page of which you are
                        now, here you can find out information about the developer, the project and its goals. Below are
                        the goals that the developer set for <u>himself</u>.
